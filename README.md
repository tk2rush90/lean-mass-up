# Lean Mass Up

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

## Overview

This is side project to learn how to draw interactive canvas.

Main goal of this was creating canvas wave which can show waving by user interaction.

However, the interaction feature is removed because my studying is not enough to implement them.

So what you can see are only waving backgrounds and lean mass up diet calculator/manager/recorder.
